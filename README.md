# pyqrack-qunetsim-plugin

This repository contains a PyQrackBackend for QuNetSim.

The underlying Qrack simulator is a high-performance, GPU-accelarated, noiseless simulator, by design.

**This plugin is _not_ yet distributed on pypi.** You can clone the repository and install it locally:
```
pip install .
```
in the repository root directory.
